**Description**

AutoCam is a real-time, markerless, path-planning framework for the da Vinci Research Kit enabling one patient-side manipulator to autonomously position an auxiliary camera. The auxiliary camera provides an additional viewpoint while the other robotic manipulators can be driven to complete surgical tasks. The feature is the ring of the single-handed wire-chaser task which is tracked via robot kinematics; however, visual tracking can be easily integrated with our system to enable tracking of other features.
